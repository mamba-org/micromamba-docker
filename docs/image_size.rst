Minimizing final image size
===========================

Uwe Korn has a nice `blog post
<https://uwekorn.com/2021/03/01/deploying-conda-environments-in-docker-how-to-do-it-right.html>`_
on making small containers containing conda environments that is a good
resource. He uses ``mamba`` instead of ``micromamba``, but the general concepts still
apply when using ``micromamba``.
