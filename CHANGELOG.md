- Add the environment variable `MAMBA_USER` to store the value of the default
  username.

## 15 December 2021

- If environmental variable `MAMBA_SKIP_ACTIVATE` is set to `1`, then no conda
  environment will be automatically activated during a `docker run ...` command.

## 14 December 2021

- Images are now built on every push to `main` branch or when cronjob sees
  that conda-forge has a newer version of micromamba that does not yet have
  a corresponding image on dockerhub
- Images will now also be tagged with a the short version of the git SHA
  hash from this git repository.
- The outputs of `check_version.py` have been modified to make the build
  scripts better

## 13 December 2021

- Remove tests that override entrypoint. Users should not expect their conda
  env to get activated if they interfere with the entrypoint script.
- Remove test of using `RUN` command with 'exec' form to access conda
  installed software. This required the `PATH` modification that is being
  removed. Use 'shell' form of `RUN` command instead.
- Remove call to `micromamba` that adds shell completion commands from
  `.bashrc`, as this is now included in the shell hooks command.

## 4 December 2021

- Activation of conda env during docker build is now triggered by
  `ARG MAMBA_DOCKERFILE_ACTIVATE=1`
- Entrypoint script moved to `/bin/_entrypoint.sh`
- `SHELL`now set to `/bin/_dockerfile_shell.sh`, which activates an
  environment within the docker build if  `MAMBA_DOCKERFILE_ACTIVATE=1`
  and then executes any arguments using `/bin/bash`
