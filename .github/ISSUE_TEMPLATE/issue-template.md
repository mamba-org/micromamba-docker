You are at the right place to submit an issue about the *dockerization* of micromamba. If you have an issue about the micromamba program, then this is not the correct place to submit your issue. Please submit micromamba issues in the [mamba/libmamba/micromamba issue tracker](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/issues).

Please read our [FAQ](https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-docker/blob/main/FAQ.md) before you create an issue.

This repo also has [Discussions](https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-docker/discussions) enabled and that may be a more appropriate location if you want to have a more open ended conversation.
